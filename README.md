Hey you, yes **you**. Thanks for landing to this repository filled with Web Development Programs prescribed for MCA by VTU. I will be using [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) for running my PHP scripts. You can also run on [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html), 

#### Index

*There is no specific index mentioned by the university thereby, I will be updating the index as and when I upload the program*

##### Caution: Use it only for reference and do raise issues if necessary.
